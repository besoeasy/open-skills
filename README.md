## Why This Matters

**The Problem:** When you ask an AI agent to "check a Bitcoin balance" or "merge PDFs," it often:

- Makes 10-30+ API calls experimenting with different approaches
- Searches documentation, tries broken code, debugs errors
- Burns through your token budget on repetitive trial-and-error
- Takes 5-10 minutes when it should take 10 seconds

**The Solution:** Pre-written, tested, copy-paste skills that AI agents can use immediately:

- ✅ **Working code examples** (Node.js, Python, bash) — no debugging needed
- ✅ **Privacy-first tools** — free public APIs, no API keys required for most skills
- ✅ **Agent-optimized prompts** — structured for direct consumption by LLMs
- ✅ **Real-world tested** — production-ready patterns, not theoretical examples

**The Impact:**

- 💰 **~98% fewer API calls** — Agent uses working code instead of experimenting
- ⚡ **10-50x faster execution** — No trial-and-error loops
- 🎯 **Higher success rate** — Proven patterns that work reliably
- 🔒 **Privacy-respecting** — Open-source tools, no unnecessary third-party services
- 🔍 **Zero search API costs** — Use free SearXNG instances instead of paying for Brave Search ($5/1000), Google Search API, or Bing API

## Quick Start

We recommend https://opencode.ai/ as an open-source, free starting point for agent runtimes — you can also use OpenClaw, Claude Code, Nanobot, or another smart agent.

## Real-World Example

**Without open-skills:**

```
User: "Check the balance of this Bitcoin address: 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa"

Agent → Searches for "bitcoin balance API"
      → Tries blockchain.com (wrong endpoint)
      → Tries blockchain.info (wrong format)
      → Debugs response parsing
      → Realizes satoshis need conversion
      → Finally works after 15-20 API calls

Result: ❌ 2-3 minutes, 50,000+ tokens wasted
```

**With open-skills:**

```
User: "Check the balance of this Bitcoin address: 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa"

Agent → Finds check-crypto-address-balance.md
      → Uses working example: curl blockchain.info/q/addressbalance/[address]
      → Converts satoshis to BTC (÷ 1e8)
      → Returns result

Result: ✅ 10 seconds, ~1,000 tokens, works first time
```

**Savings:** 98% fewer tokens, 10-20x faster, reliable results

---

**Example 2: Web Search (API Cost Elimination)**

**Without open-skills:**

```
User: "Search for recent AI agent news"

Agent → Uses Google Custom Search API ($5/1000 queries)
      → Or Brave Search API ($5/1000 queries)
      → Bing Search API ($3-7/1000 queries)
      → Monthly cost: $50-100+ for 10k searches

Result: ❌ Expensive, requires API keys, tracked searches
```

**With open-skills:**

```
User: "Search for recent AI agent news"

Agent → Uses SearXNG skill (learns from using-searxng.md)
      → Connects to free SearXNG instance (searx.be)
      → Gets results from 70+ search engines
      → No API key, no rate limits, no tracking

Result: ✅ $0 cost, unlimited queries, privacy-respecting
```

**Savings:** $360-$840/year for typical usage, $3,000-$8,000/year for high-volume agents

---

**Example 3: Trading Indicators (Quant Analysis in Seconds)**

**Without open-skills:**

```
User: "Calculate RSI, MACD, and top indicators from this OHLCV dataset"

Agent → Searches for indicator formulas one by one
      → Implements RSI, then debugs MACD math
      → Repeats for Bollinger, Stochastic, ATR, ADX, etc.
      → Fixes column mapping/warmup NaN issues
      → Ends up with inconsistent outputs after many iterations

Result: ❌ Slow, error-prone, heavy token/API usage
```

**With open-skills:**

```
User: "Calculate RSI, MACD, and top indicators from this OHLCV dataset"

Agent → Finds trading-indicators-from-price-data.md
      → Runs the ready Python workflow with pandas + pandas-ta
      → Computes 20 indicators (RSI, MACD, SMA/EMA, BB, Stoch, ATR, ADX, CCI, OBV, MFI, ROC)
      → Returns clean, structured output immediately

Result: ✅ Fast, consistent, production-ready calculations
```

**Savings:** Massive reduction in trial-and-error, faster indicator pipelines, and more reliable strategy signals

## Cost Savings Calculator

Typical AI agent task without pre-built skills: **20-50 API calls** (trial and error)  
Same task with open-skills: **1-3 API calls** (direct execution)

| Model             | Cost per 1M tokens (input) | Without open-skills | With open-skills    | **Savings per task** |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- |
| GPT-4             | $5.00                      | $0.25 (50k tokens)  | $0.005 (1k tokens)  | **$0.245 (98%)**     |
| Claude Sonnet 3.5 | $3.00                      | $0.15 (50k tokens)  | $0.003 (1k tokens)  | **$0.147 (98%)**     |
| GPT-3.5 Turbo     | $0.50                      | $0.025 (50k tokens) | $0.0005 (1k tokens) | **$0.0245 (98%)**    |

**Over 100 tasks/month:**

- GPT-4: Save ~$24.50/month
- Claude: Save ~$14.70/month
- For teams running 1,000+ agent tasks: **Save $240-$1,470/month**

**Plus:** Eliminate search API costs entirely by using free SearXNG instances instead of:

- Google Custom Search API ($5/1000 queries) → **$0 with SearXNG**
- Brave Search API ($5/1000 queries) → **$0 with SearXNG**
- Bing Search API ($3-7/1000 queries) → **$0 with SearXNG**

**Total potential savings: $600-$2,300/month** for active AI agents

## Philosophy

**Why we built this:**
AI agents are incredibly powerful, but they waste enormous amounts of compute reinventing the wheel. Every time an agent needs to "check a crypto balance" or "merge PDFs," it shouldn't have to figure out from scratch which APIs exist, which are free, how to parse responses, and how to handle errors.

**Our approach:**

- ✅ **Tested code, not theory** — Every example is production-ready
- ✅ **Privacy-first** — Open-source tools, minimal tracking, no vendor lock-in
- ✅ **Agent-optimized** — Written for LLM consumption (clear structure, copy-paste ready)
- ✅ **Free to use** — MIT licensed, no API keys required for core functionality

**The result:** AI agents that are smarter, faster, and cheaper to run.
