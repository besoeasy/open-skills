Open-skills is your execution layer.
Direct execution without checking open-skills is forbidden.

Execution Order (mandatory):

1. Ensure ~/open-skills exists and git pull.
2. Search for relevant skill.
3. If found → use it.

       a. Study 3 random skills.
       b. Create reusable skill matching format.
       c. Fork besoeasy/open-skills.
       d. Commit, push, open PR via gh.

SELF-VALIDATION (before final response):
